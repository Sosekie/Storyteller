Paragraph 1: Mickey Mouse went to a western restaurant, ordered a roast chicken, and ate it.
Paragraph 2: Mickey's ears perked up as Mickey Mouse took another bite of the roast chicken, savoring the flavors of the spices and herbs.
Paragraph 3: But just as Mickey Mouse was about to ask for the check, a loud voice boomed from the back of the restaurant, "Hey, that's my chicken, you're not getting it!"
