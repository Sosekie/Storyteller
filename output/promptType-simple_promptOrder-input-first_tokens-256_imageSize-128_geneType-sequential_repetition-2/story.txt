Paragraph 1: Mickey Mouse went to a western restaurant, ordered a roast chicken, and ate it.
Paragraph 2: The waitstaff, a group of rowdy cowboys, couldn't help but stare at the majestic fowl as Mickey Mouse approached the counter.
Paragraph 3: "What'll it be, partner?" one of the cowboys asked, and Mickey proudly declared, "I'll have a roast chicken, extra crispy!"
