Paragraph 1: Mickey Mouse went to a western restaurant, ordered a roast chicken, and ate it.
Paragraph 2: As Mickey Mouse was eating, Mickey Mouse heard a voice behind Mickey Mouse say, "You're a real scoundrel, aren't you?" Mickey turned around to see a cowboy, dressed in a black duster coat, staring at Mickey Mouse with a scowl on Mickey Mouse's face.
Paragraph 3: The cowboy's eyes narrowed as Mickey Mouse took a step closer, Mickey Mouse's hand resting on the butt of Mickey Mouse's holstered pistol.
