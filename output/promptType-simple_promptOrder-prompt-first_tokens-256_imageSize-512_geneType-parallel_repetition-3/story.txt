Paragraph 1: Mickey Mouse went to a western restaurant, ordered a roast chicken, and ate it.
Paragraph 2: When Mickey Mouse got home, Pluto, Mickey Mouse's loyal dog, was sitting by the window, looking sad.
Paragraph 3: Mickey asked Pluto if Mickey Mouse was okay and Pluto replied, "I'm just feeling a little ruff, Mickey."  Mickey chuckled and said, "Don't worry, buddy, I'll give you a belly rub to make you feel better."  Pluto's tail wagged, and Mickey Mouse licked Mickey's face, and Mickey knew that everything was going to be okay.
