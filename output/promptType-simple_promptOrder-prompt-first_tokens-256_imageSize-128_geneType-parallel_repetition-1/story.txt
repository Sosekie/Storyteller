Paragraph 1: Mickey Mouse went to a western restaurant, ordered a roast chicken, and ate it.
Paragraph 2: The chicken was so good that Mickey Mouse asked for seconds, and then thirds, and fourths, and so on, until Mickey Mouse had eaten every last morsel.
Paragraph 3: When Mickey Mouse finished, Mickey Mouse felt a strange sensation and suddenly found himself back in Mickey Mouse's own kitchen, standing in front of Mickey Mouse's own stove, where a roast chicken was waiting for Mickey Mouse.
